# ML Image Colorization

Developed as part of the coursework for CAP5404 - Deep Learning For Computer Graphics

## Description

In this project, we will be exploring the application of machine learning to computer graphics. Specifically, automatic image colorization. The first part of the project involves the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based regression algorithm for the prediction of mean chrominance values, followed by a colorizer model that colorizes an input image just by taking in the luminance information. The second part of the project is based on a transfer learning approach to develop automatic colorization models for the NCD benchmark dataset.
